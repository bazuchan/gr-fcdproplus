gr-fcdproplus is an linux and OSX addon for gnuradio to implement a funcube dongle pro+ source.
On linux autodetects the correct soundcard from /proc/asound/cards.
This idea was taken from the osmosdr drivers.

To control the device the hidraw code of the hidapi is used.


1. Dependencies:

- gnuradio
- alsa usb drivers activated

2. Installation

get the latest code from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus

The build process is cmake based. So change to code directory.
There
$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where gnuradio is installed> ../
$make
$su
$make install

After that you'll find in grc in Sources
Funcube Dongle Pro+ source
3. Important

Don't forget the udev rules:
For instance:

# Udev rules for the Funcube Dongle Pro (0xfb56) and Pro+ (0xfb31)

# HIDAPI/libusb:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb" ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8" ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb56" MODE:="0666"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb" ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8" ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb31" MODE:="0666"

# HIDAPI/hidraw:
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{busnum}=="1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb56", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{busnum}=="1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb31", MODE="0666"
